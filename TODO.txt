DONE:
- GPU FFTs + bandpass, handles an arbitrary number of FFTs in 20ms-100ms on average depending on size (<20ms usually for a single channel, it beats jsfft). Tested up to 128 channels of simulated data. 
- Coherence
- uPlot for live time series charts for any number of channels. 
    -- FFT plots, raw data plot, stacked raw data plot (was a pain in the ass but looks good), coherence plot
- Smoothie charts for streaming simple time series (I thought it looked like this one muse charting applet I used)
- heatmapjs + canvas for a brain atlas + heat map. 
   -- The canvas creates points based off the given MNI atlas coordinates with tags e.g. Fp1, Fp2, Fz, etc.
   -- Points assigned to channels are highlighted with the channel index listed
- Web/Blob workers for CPU or GPU processing with multithread.js (works local or hosted)



TODO:

Data:
- CSV saving, make it sensible!
- More charting options e.g. bandpower timeseries heatmap (can do in uPlot)
- Post processing e.g. for full session data rather than just the last second of realtime data. E.g. ERP analysis (https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/34/5/907/1886959)
- Check out bci.js for applicability, mainly the fast bandpower extraction
- More signal analysis math as needed, I have to learn it all from scratch usually due to deficiencies in other libraries

Visuals: 
- Nice UI layout and CSS
- Toggling for different visuals
- Colored bars for bandpowers (another typical EEG visual in home software)
- Brain network map for more complex coherence

Performance:
- I could definitely optimize most of the math but if it ain't broke don't fix it.. yet.. We could probably push 30FPS at least with the mass FFTs on the GPU, there are compute shader examples that do them in microseconds.

Use cases:
- Alpha coherence
- Theta-Gamma 2 Octave by Dmitry

Compatibility:
- Windows has a default driver incompatibility. This does not seem to persist in some EEG software on Windows, which may use different drivers.
- Test Mac, Linux is fine
